## Sample Appointments Application

A 'Appointments' sample application is given as starting point for the Medium story 
_Integration tests — an approach for the REST API_.
 

The master branch has no tests, ideal if you want to try out while reading the story. 

The complete branch, well, is complete. 

> Please, don't consider this sample as template, as it lacks some good practices for the sake of "simplicity".


## Setup

**Clone or download the zip file**

**Open it in a IDE of choice**

If you are not familiar with the Gradle build tool, it's just like maven. Open it like you use to open a maven project.

If the preference is not to use an IDE, run './gradlew' (Linux/Mac) or 'gradlew' (Windows) to perform a complete build. 

It will download the right version of Gradle.

**Run it**

Execute ./gradlew bootRun, see if it's all good.

The master branch is to be completed. However, it does contain all dependencies needed to follow up the story.
